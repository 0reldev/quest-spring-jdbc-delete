# Quest "Spring & JDBC 4: Delete"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest teaches how to delete an entry selected by its id into a database with Spring JDBC.

We are given a SQL file to import containing a database: characters and school from Harry Potter's book. 
 
The wizards deletion routes work, the aim is to repair the schools routes for making the deletion possible with JDBC.
